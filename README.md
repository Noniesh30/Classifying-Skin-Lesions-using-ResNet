**Project Description: Classifying Skin Lesions using ResNet-18 and ResNet-152**

This project aims to classify images of skin lesions into different categories using two deep learning architectures: ResNet-18 and ResNet-152. ResNet-18 and ResNet-152 are convolutional neural network (CNN) models renowned for their performance in image classification tasks.

**ResNet-18**: A lighter version of the ResNet architecture with 18 layers, suitable for smaller datasets or when computational resources are limited.

**ResNet-152**: A deeper version of the ResNet architecture with 152 layers, capable of capturing more intricate features and patterns, typically used for larger datasets and demanding tasks.

The project provides a space for downloading the skin lesion dataset, essential for training and evaluating the models. The dataset contains images of various types of skin lesions, along with corresponding labels, facilitating the development of robust classification models.
